                                           Statistical Analysis on Fifa & Mobile Network Dataset

The first and second problem aims at finding the relevant variables that contribute to explaining the variation in the target variable and doing the required graphical analysis to confirm the same.

1. Perform the following statistical analysis on the FIFA world cup dataset. The dataset consists of player information, which includes height; weight overall rating, potential, etc. Data Cleaning and basic EDA process need to be performed. 

a)	Assuming age as population, perform the central limit theorem with a sample size of 200. Find the standard error and the mean of the sampling distribution. Compare the results with the population mean and standard deviation. Explain in non-technical terms why the estimated standard error of a sample mean tends to decrease with an increase in sample size

b)	Is there any evidence that the player's overall rating is greater than 80?

c)	Perform the statistical test to identify whether the preferred foot has any impact on potential. Also, perform the graphical analysis.

d)	Perform the statistical test to identify the relation between the overall rating and potential. [Assume both are continuous data points].

e)	Does skill move have any effect on overall rating? Perform the graphical analysis and the statistical analysis.

**Note:**
* Perform all the Statistical analysis with 5% (Significance level).
* Assume all the features are normally distributed and have equal variance.


2. Perform the following statistical analysis on the mobile network dataset given. The given data set contains information about the internet, calls, and messages of various networks. Data Cleaning and basic EDA process need to be performed. 

a) With 95% & 99% Confidence Intervals, find the range estimate of average duration calls made by the entire network. Which of the Intervals is wider? Interpret the results.

b) Perform statistical analysis to check whether the networks are equally distributed in the dataset.

c) Plot the distribution of duration with respect to each network in the same graph and interpret the results from the graph.

d)	Perform statistical tests to identify the relation between the item and duration. A detailed explanation of the relation between the classes is required.

e)	Perform statistical tests to identify the relation between network and network_type. 

**Note:**
* Perform all the Statistical analysis with 5% (Significance level).
* Perform the test of normality and test of variance in the appropriate places.
